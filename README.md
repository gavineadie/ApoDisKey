### ApoDisKey

(the name "DSKY" is taken in the Apple Store)

* It looks like the "separator" lines illuminate.  Purpose?

* channel 165 (octal) has been silent for a long time [expecting at least 164 second repeat?)

.. where is the "AGC Warning” [channel 163 — Bit 1: AGC] .. on another panel, audible?

   _An AGC warning alarm is generated in the event of AGC power failure, scaler failure of either of 
   two types, restart or counter failure during AGC operation, or in response to an alarm test program. 
   A scaler fail or prime power fail result in an immediate alarm indication whereas the other inputs 
   are buffered by a filter so as to prevent transient disturbances from causing a warning alarm._
