### ApoDisKey

(the name "DSKY" is taken in the Apple Store)

* It looks like the "separator" lines illuminate.  Purpose?

* channel 165 (octal) hasn’t been silent for a long time [expecting at least 164 second repeat?)

.. and one question: Where is the "AGC Warning” [channel 163 — Bit 1: AGC] .. on another panel, audible?

   An AGC warning alarm is generated in the event of AGC power failure, scaler failure of either of 
   two types, restart or counter failure during AGC operat[ion], or in response to an alarm test program. 
   A scaler fail or prime power fail result in an immediate alarm indication whereas the other inputs 
   are buffered by a filter so as to prevent transient disturbances from causing a warning alarm.
