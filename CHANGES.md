.. where is the "AGC Warning” [channel 163 — Bit 1: AGC] .. on another panel,
audible?

   _An AGC warning alarm is generated in the event of AGC power failure, scaler
   failure of either of two types, restart or counter failure during AGC
   operation, or in response to an alarm test program. A scaler fail or prime
   power fail result in an immediate alarm indication whereas the other inputs
   are buffered by a filter so as to prevent transient disturbances from causing
   a warning alarm._
